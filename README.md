# My-AI-Maths-Journey
This Repository contains everything which I made while learning the Maths for Artificial Intelligence. 

## Resources for Learning AI and Maths for AI
I Used this Resource for learning about Artificial Intelligence:
[AI Engineer Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_x8zg7xLUPkE1OskZDjCO5EwgHwHfxfgPrFGTN9rTcU/edit?usp=sharing)

For Creating the above Roadmap I used Chatgpt and a bit of Prompt Engineering. 

For Now I am just Starting my journey of becoming a **AI Engineer**. I will solely relying on YouTube, Coursera, MIT Opencourseware, Harvard CS50, Edx and other education platforms for learning and I will be updating everything which I do everyday here. :))
See Ya Soon!
